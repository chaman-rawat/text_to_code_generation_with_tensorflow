# Text-to-code Generation with TensorFlow, ðŸ¤— & MBPP

In this notebook we will finetune CodeT5 on MBPP - Mostly Basic Python Problems by Google Research to generate code based on problem description. MBPP is a benchmark that consists of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, designed to be solvable by entry level programmers, covering programming fundamentals, standard library functionality, and so on. Each problem consists of a task description, code solution and 3 automated test cases.

The notebook demonstrates how to finetune CodeT5 on MBPP Dataset w/ TensorFlow.
